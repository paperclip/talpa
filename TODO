- Consolidate config strings list from cache, exclusion processor and vetting controller
  into shared object based system? - Tvrtko

- The whole config system could use a re-desing I think.
     - searching the list in setConfig() - whats the point since we wouldn't be there
       if the items weren't exported
     - then doing strcmp to find which configuration item and act on it. - Again, whats
       the point if we already have the right one from the list search
     - actual configuration functions access pod_configuration_elements by array index which
       is totally un-flexible. A pointer to right string could be passed from setConfig
     - each module implements basically the same setConfig skeleton
